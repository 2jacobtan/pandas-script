# pandas-script
clean / merge data

Simplified version can easily be done via Power Query (a data import and manipulation feature built into Microsoft Excel and Power BI).

Features:

• Automatically detect relevant files placed in a folder. (Specified in separate .txt file.)

• Multiple passes to progessively clean data (user did not value such a feature -shrugs-)

• Automatically append output files with timestamp, placed in separate folder for each category

— Python is overkill for such a task. Redone in Power Query (built-in extract/transform/load tool in Excel and Power BI).
