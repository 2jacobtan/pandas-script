# pandas-script
clean / merge data

Features:

• Automatically detect relevant files placed in a folder. (specified in separate .txt file)

• Multiple passes to progessively clean data (user did not value such a feature -shrugs-)

• Automatically append output files with timestamp, placed in separate folder for each category

— Python is overkill for such a task. [**Redone in Power Query**](https://github.com/2jacobtan/Power-Query-M) (built-in extract-transform-load tool in Excel and Power BI).

Desired improvements:

• place related functions in separate modules

• appropriate type annotations

• first-time Pandas user; code is littered with print()
